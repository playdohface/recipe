#Adding Modules
## Find the project root
[look here](C:\Users\WindowsSucks\butanyway)
To `find` the `project-root` of a Rust-project:
```sh find-root (object)
cargo locate-project
```
Set `output` to `output.root`
To `add` a `module` with a given `--name`:
`this means nothing
`
[this means nothing]
(this means nothing)
A keyword at the end of a line: Execute
However, a keyword not immediately followed by whitespace means nothing: To.
This means nothing: ### Fake Heading
                        ### this is still a heading
